    /// ```swift
    /// ISO_9899.String.Copy.copy(to: dest, from: src)
    /// ISO_9899.String.Copy.copy(to: dest, from: src, count: n)
    /// ```

    /// Copies the string pointed to by `source` (including the terminating
    /// null character) into the array pointed to by `destination`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - destination: Pointer to destination buffer.
    ///   - source: Pointer to null-terminated source string.
    /// - Returns: The `destination` pointer.
    ///
    /// - Precondition: `destination` must have enough space for the source string.
    /// - Precondition: Source and destination must not overlap.

    ///   - destination: Pointer to destination buffer.
    ///   - source: Pointer to source string.
